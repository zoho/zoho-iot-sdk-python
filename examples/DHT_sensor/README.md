# Zoho IoT SDK - Raspberry Pi DHT Sensor Example

## Overview

This directory contains an example of using the Zoho IoT SDK with a Raspberry Pi to read data from a DHT sensor. The provided script demonstrates how to interact with GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi board to read temperature and humidity data from the DHT sensor and send it to the Zoho IoT platform.

## Directory Structure

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies required for the `rpi_dht_sensor_sample.py` script.
- **`rpi_dht_sensor_sample.py`**: Python script that reads data from a DHT sensor and sends it to Zoho IoT.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi 4** or **Raspberry Pi 5**
- Python 3.6 or higher
- DHT sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
